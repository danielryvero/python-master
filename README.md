## 🧠 Master's Final Project: Machine Learning for Crime Analysis

**Description:**  
This project was developed as part of the final assignment for my Big Data and Business Intelligence master's degree at the European Postgraduate Institute (IEP). It focuses on detecting patterns in crime-related data using supervised machine learning. I conducted an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), handled imbalanced classes, and compared multiple classification algorithms to evaluate performance through precision, recall, and AUC.

**Key Highlights:**
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Interpretation of false positives/negatives
- Visualization of class distributions and model outcomes
- Comparison of logistic regression, random forests, and XGBoost
- Justification of model choice based on business needs and statistical evidence
